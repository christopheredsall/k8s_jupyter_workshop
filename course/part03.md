# Step 3 - Building your first docker image

In the [last lesson](part02.md) you found that the dependencies of the workshop-in-a-workshop were anaconda python, pyqrcode, pymaging and pymaging-png.

These were installed using:

* pyqrcode: `pip install qrcode[pil]`
* pymaging: `pip install git+git://github.com/ojii/pymaging.git#egg=pymaging`
* pymaging-png: `pip install git+git://github.com/ojii/pymaging-png.git#pymaging-png`
